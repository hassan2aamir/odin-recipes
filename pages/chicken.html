            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅔ tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon ground thyme</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon basil</li>
            <li>⅓ tablespoon oregano</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder</li>
            <li>4 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ground white pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Accent flavor enhancer (MSG) optional</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup full-fat buttermilk</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into breast, thigh, leg, and wing pieces.</li>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, mix together the flour and all of the seasonings.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add buttermilk and beaten egg. Stir or whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces to the buttermilk mixture.</li>
            <li>Soak the chicken for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a wire rack on top of a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>To bread the chicken, remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Place each piece into the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken fully and then shake off all of the excess flour.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken onto the wire rack.</li>
            <li>Bread all of the chicken. The breaded chicken should rest for about 15 minutes before frying.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees in a deep fryer. If you do not have a deep fryer you should use a Dutch oven and fill it half full of vegetable shortening. If you are using a Dutch oven, use a thermometer to make sure the temperature is maintained at 350 degrees. If the temperature drops too low, the breading will become greasy.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken in 2 or 3 batches. The breasts and thighs will take about 15 to 18 minutes to cook. The wings and legs will take about 12 to 13 minutes to cook.</li>
            <li>Drain the fried chicken on a clean wire rack on top of a baking sheet.</li>
            
        </ol>
